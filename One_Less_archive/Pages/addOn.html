    Page, Chapter by Chapter, Verse by Verse, ask yourself, What does this tell me about who Jesus is and what He wants
    to do with my life?"

    // Reasons Jesus Died on the cross.
    1. To be an example to man on how to live Jn 13:5

    3. To trade places with man II Cor 5:21
    <br><br>
    // Fair Questions from secular to Christians
    - Do you know your starting position is A. Extreme and B. Irrelevant?
    - Do you know you are rooted only in past experiences and future hope? Unneccessary for a "good life" today
    - When a problem occurs, will Christianity help the solution?
    - Can Christian leaders be trusted? Are they credible? Are they wise?
    - What Exactly does following Jesus require?
    - How will you talk about politics, sexuality, social issues, pop issues early in a conversation so they don't walk
    away? Perception is Christians are unreliable on these issues because their positions are unpractical.
    - How do Christians generate good in the world? The perception is Christians typically say "stop" and "don't"
    - What can you offer outside charitable work: food, clothing, shelter, counseling, disaster relief?
    - Do you know that everthing Christians offer, so do secular organizations? mission services, charity, sabbath day
    behavior, community wellness, fasting, being spiritual, life coaches, etc.

    // Scripture regarding using bad language (Jam 3:8 / Eph 4:29)<br>
    // Talk about "IDEAL" vs "REAL". God/Bible is Ideal. Culture/Current Events are Real. How do we blend the two
    because it is necessary if Christians are going to get the message across to non-Christians.<br>
    // Consider making one liners "not optional" must go through each one in order: per Mark Mason
    <br><br>
    // use the statement, " Free from the law to be saved by grace " Somewhere. LOL. It describes that you/me are born
    in sin and tied or attached to the laws of moses but the covenant of grace overrides and frees you from the the
    moseanic laws and you become " saved under the covenant of grace. "

    //SOME FACTS.....
    // II Tim 3:16 - All scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in
    righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work
    // Gal 1:8-9 - But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God's curse! (The gospel being referrenced is I Cor 15:1-4, more detail thru verse 8)
    Col 2:18 - Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind.
    // Apostacy: Turning your back on scripture. Perverting the scripture.
    // Jonh 7:16 - Jesus said my teaching came from God. Gal 1:11-12 Paul said my teaching came from Jesus.
    // Moses=>Law=>Jews   Paul=>Grace=>Gentiles
