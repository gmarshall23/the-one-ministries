  <h4>How Do You Know You Are Saved?<button>test</button></h4>


  <p class="white">I John 5:13 says: I <em class="chartreuse">write</em> these things to you who <em
      class="chartreuse">believe</em> in the name of the <em class="chartreuse">Son of God</em> so that you may <em
      class="chartreuse">know</em> that you have <em class="chartreuse">eternal life</em>.</p>
  <p class="white">For whatever reason, when it comes to knowledge of spiritual things we look for an emotional response
    or feeling. It is quite possible that you may feel emotion and that is great, yet God's truths are always rooted in
    scripture. The highlighted words above are THE proof positive that you need in order to confirm your Salvation
    should you ever have reason to question it or doubt it. Read the supporting scriptures and verify without a doubt
    that your Eternal Life is SECURE.</p>

  <p class="white">First, here are the likely reasons you may question your Salvation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="white">Doubt - Conviction by the Holy Spirit (John 16:8)</li>
    <li class="white">Contradiction in your lifestyle - Not Living Right (Gal 5:19-21)</li>
    <li class="white">Confusion - Not sure what Salvation really is thinking that you must earn it(John 16:28 / I John
      4:10)</li>
    <li class="white">Condemnation of Satan - Doubt, fear, and emptiness (John 8:44)</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="chartreuse">WRITE: II Pet 1:16-21</p>
  <p class="chartreuse">BELIEVE: John 11: 25 / John 3:16 / Acts 16:31 / John 3:14-16 / John 20:31</p>
  <p class="chartreuse">SON OF GOD: Trust Completely in Jesus not self. Faith Requires an Object to believe in. The
    object is Jesus Christ. Acts 4:8-12.</p>
  <p class="chartreuse">KNOW: I John 5:13 / I John 2:5 & 20-21 / I John 4:13</p>
  <p class="chartreuse">ETERNAL LIFE: I John 5:12 / John 10:10 / II Cor 13:5 (test yourself - do you have and fruit or
    any works?)</p>
  <h4>Can you Lose your Salvation</h4>
  <p class="white">Once you are saved, you are saved forever. These scriptures support this understanding:</p>
  <ol class="white">
    <li class="white">John 3:16</li>
    <li class="white">John 5:24</li>
    <li class="white">John 6:39-40</li>
    <li class="white">John 10:27-29</li>
    <li class="white">Rom 8:28-30</li>
    <li class="white">I Pet 1:3-4</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="white"><img class="cloud" src="../images/cross.jpeg" alt="church">However, if you chose this page  you likely are aware of the statements from
    Hebrews 6:4-6 which declares that "for those who have once been enlightened, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who
    have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have fallen away, to be brought
    back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public
    disgrace."</p>
  <p class="white">Hebrews 10:26-27 says, "If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of
    the truth, no sacrifice for sin is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgement and of raging fire that will
    consume the enemies of God...</p>
  <p class="white">Though, we cannot unhear such strong declarations, so it bears repeating that everyone should be absolutely
    sure they truly want a relationship with God and ulitmately receive eternal life before commiting their lives to
    Christianity. Let me put it in other words a bit more direct and simple. The a fore mentioned verses from Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 10 speak of those who
    "Profess"
    their Christianity in that they can absolutely claim experiences or tastes from the cup of the Gospel. Let me put a lid on that box and seal it  permanently by reading 1 John 2:18-19. Please read it for yourself but it basically says that people who fit this description NEVER really "belonged" to us. A born
    again, saved, Christian will actually have drank from the cup of the Gospel and "Possess" salvation; NEVER EVER TO LOSE IT!
    (EXAMPLES: <span class="purple">Profess</span> - Judas, King Saul, King Nebuchadnezzar, 5 of the 10 virgins; <span class="purple">Possess</span> - Moses, Job,
    Elijah, Paul, Peter,
    The other 5 virgins)</p>
  <p class="white">Personally, I have both heard and found it to be true that staying in "growth mode" always trying
    each day to know God better, be more like Jesus, listen to the Holy Spirit, keeps me assured that I belong to the
    Lord and have my place secure in eternity. Joshua 1:8-9 encourages us to stay in growth mode and <u

    10:4-5 which I consider to be a reset button of the mind. I stand strongly that if we get our mind right then
    everything falls into place.</p>
  <h4>Why do we not Agree on the Facts <span class="pix10">(not sure where to put this tag)</span></h4>
  <p class="white">Well, this is really not a new concept, yet there are times when the concept is more prevalent than
    others. This is such a time as culture has become more popular than God's truth. Science also rates itself and it's
    findings above God's truth. However, God in his infinite wisdom, spoke about exactly this in the books of Romans and I
    Corinthians. In Romans 1:18-32 and I Cor 1: 17-31, Paul explains that God gave up on them and does not reveal himself to non believers. Moreover, he
    confuses them purposely and uses words like frustrate, foolish, and shame to describe the thinking and behavior of those who
    assume their wisdom above his. Therefore, don't be surprised at the differences, big and small, that separate God's
    truth from man's culture.</p>
