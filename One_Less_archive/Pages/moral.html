  <h3>Moral Inventory<button class="btn btn-primary graceBtn pix10">The Grace in Moral Inventory</button></h3>
  <p class="white"><img class="cloud tall" src="../images/cross.jpeg" alt="church">I firmly believe that all believers
        should check themselves regularly against their own personal
        Moral Inventory. As the author of this site, I am sharing mine (in no order of importance) as a sample of what I do monthly. I speak to myself in the affirmative, reminding myself who I am in Christ. I am not perfect, as God already knows, and where I fall short, I ask God for help to improve and grow in my spiritual walk. I invite you to  develop your own Moral Inventory below and check yourself against it regularly and trust God to move you forward. Bear in mind that yours, just like mine can and should change as the Holy Spirit guides your thoughts and actions.</p>
  <ol class="white">
    <p class="pink">Greg's Personal Moral Inventory</p>
    <li> Because Jesus said to Love one another (John 19:34-35), I do not persecute others.</li>
        <li> Because Jesus said I am salt and light and to make disciples (Matt 5:13-16, 28:19), I share my faith and demonstrate goodness and kindness.</li>
        <li> Because God is slow to anger (Exodus 34:6), I am patient in all things when necessary.</li>
        <li> Because God forgave me (Colossians 3:13), I forgive others quickly.</li>
        <li> Because God made me and my wife one flesh (Eph 5:31, Matt 19:6, Gen 2:24), I do not lust for other women or desire divorce</li>
        <li> Because God gave me mercy and grace (Hebrews 4:16), I look to offer mercy and grace to others</li>
        <li> Because Jesus forgave his enemies (Luke 23:24), I forgive those who offend me</li>
        <li> Because God loves a cheerful giver (Proverbs 28:27, II Corinthians 9:7), I give willingly to those in need</li>
        <li> Because God wants to hear from me regularly (I Thessalonians 5:17), I pray regularly</li>
        <li> Because God hates evil (Romans 12:9), I love and fear the Lord (Psalms 97:10, Proverbs 8:13) and hate evil</li>
        <li> Because God said no weapon formed against me will prosper (Isaiah 54:17/Romans 8:31,37), I pray earnestly for my enemies</li>
        <li> Because Jesus never worried (Phillipians 4:6), I am not anxious about situations</li>
        <li> Because God tells me not to think more highly of myself than I ought to (Romans 12:3), I do not judge others</li>
        <li> Because God uses me to do  his work, (II Timothy 2:15), I study the word of God to know the truth</li>
        <li>Because the Holy Spirit guides me (Galatians 5:25), I demonstrate it fruits: Love/Peace/Joy/Kindness/Goodness/Gentleness/Faith/Paitence/Self-Control + Humility (added just for me by me) </li>
        <li> Because Jesus is ALIVE in me (Galatians 2:20), I do not have a signature sin</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="white">One additional thought is that you also need to consider the "gray" areas where scripture does not
    specify a "Thou shall ... or Thou shall not ...". Things of this nature might include dancing, responsible drinking,
    consuming certain foods, attending LGBTQ+ events, etc. I have wrestled with this concept because this is where most
    of us live on a daily basis as we face similar choices at home, work, and with family. Frankly, there are not yes or
    no - right or wrong answers because each situation is its own entity. So now I ask myself these questions and it
    really helps me to simplify my position and be at peace with my choices and decisions. Feel free to use my process
    or develop your own. The important thing is that you become intentional about your choices rather than involve
    yourself in things for the wrong reasons.</p>
  <ol class="white">Questions for my gray areas:
    <li>Greg, Do you have doubts about doing this activity?</li>
    <li>Greg, Can you thank God for the experience of what you just did?</li>
    <li>Greg, Will you be embarrassed if you are being judged for making this choice?</li>
    <li>Greg, Will your choice help or hurt other people?</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="white">Often times my environment, timing, participants help guide my choices also. For example, I would not
    have a drink with a recovering alcoholic. I would not dance loosely in ways that might tempt others but would
    absolutely enjoy an appropriate dance with my wife. Make sense ??? Continue to pray when facing similar choices and
    let God and the Holy Spirit Guide your thinking.</p>

  <p class="chartreuse pix10">** NOTE: I suggest that you involve yourself with the things on this page privately
    between you and God as these are personal to you specifically. It's certainly fine to share as I have shared mine
    with you as an example or for accountability with a trusted companion but you need to be free to be totally honest
    and sincere with your thoughts, feelings and inputs.</p>
