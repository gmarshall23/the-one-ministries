  <h1>Hello, Good to Meet You</h1>
  <p class="white">True Story...Years ago, I moved into a neighborhood with my wife and three kids. I was not new to the
    city, but I was not familiar with the neighborhood and did not know anyone. I suppose it was a two or three days
    after moving in that the doorbell rang and it was the woman from across the street. She handed me a cake and a note
    and quickly walked away before I could even get a word out. My wife and I read the note that simply said "welcome to
    the neighborhood" and then upon my insistence, I threw the cake away. I thought, "Lady, I don't know you and why do
    you think I want anything from you let alone eat something from you?" And I had several other "why" questions after
    that. The root of my position came from a place of distrust and unknown.</p>
  <p class="pink">This is how many of us approach our relationship with God. We are skeptical of receiving a free gift
    from an entity unknown or perhaps in a moment of emotion, we accept the gift of salvation only to realize that you
    have made a lifetime decision to serve a God that you don't really know or trust.</p>
  <p class="white">That's ok, its perfectly human and perfectly normal. God wants you to know him just as well as he
    already knows you and the cool part is that it is absolutely possible. Everyone is wired differently but I am pretty
    sure you fall into one or more of the following categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <a href="" class="pink">
    <li>I want to know God on an intellectual level, How do I know he really exists? (Rom 1:20/Ps 85:25, archeology, scrolls, everything discovered only proves, nothing refutes)</li></a><br>
    <a href="" class="white">
      <li>I want to know He is the only God, How do I know he is the only giver and gifter of eternal life? (John 14:6, 2 Kings 19:5,19, Isa 37:16, 1 Tim 2:5, Deut 4:32, way,truth,life scrip)</li>
    </a><br>
    <a href="" class="pink">
    <li>I want to know he can deliver for me, How do I know I can really trust Him with EVERYTHING? (test me scrip)</li>
    </a>
  </ol>


  <p class="white">The Bible reveals the nature of God as a spirit, unity,nand trinity. He is a spirit--a personal,
    infinite being (John 4:24); He is one--one in substnace or nature and incapable of being divided into separate parts
    (Deut 6:4); and he is three--eternally existing in three coequal persons (Matthew 28:19). While great mystery
    surrounds God's nature, it is reassuring to know that our God is above us.</p>
  <p class="pink">God's attributes are merely words we use to describe how God is and how he acts toward us. Among these attributes are love, holiness, constancy, justice, truth, eternalness, omnisceince (all-knowing), omnipresence (all-presence), and omnipotence (all-powerful). The fact that we can grasp and understand this much about God is evidence of God's desire that all peoples may know him.</p>
  <ol class="white">
    <li>Before you make a lifetime decision, you need to get to know who God is</li>
    <li>Before you make a lifetime decision, you need to know why choose God</li>
    <li>Before you make a lifetime decision, you need to what God will do</li>
  </ol>
