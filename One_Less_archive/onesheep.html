    <li>Soooo...How where exactly are you right NOW and how did you get Lost?</li>
    <ul>Your Answer: I AM LOST and ALONE. I am a backslider, or I am an addict, or I have been abused, or <u>(your story)</u></ul>
    <ul>My Answer: You are lost and alone because you trusted in yourself and did what you thought best to help or handle your situation.</ul>
    <li>Soooo..Why are you still Lost?</li>
    <ul>Your Answer: No one cares or No one wants me or No one is willing to help me or <u>(your thoughts)</u></ul>
    <ul>My Answer: You currently lack faith that God has the answer to your problem and you lack trust that God can and will solve your problem</ul>
    <li>Soooo...How do you get Home?</li>
    <ul>Your Answer: I have no idea what will actually work this time.</ul>
    <ul>My Answer: God really wants you back home. He wants you to tell HIM what happened; tell HIM  you want things to change; and ask HIM how to change or remove what is holding you back and bring you home. Yes, it really  is  that  simple.</ul ><!-- Repent in Grace (restraining grace: Ps 19:11, restoring grace: Ps 19:13) -->
  </ol>

  <div class="para1">
    <span class="pix25"><u>EXPECTATIONS</u></span><br><br>
    <p>In complete honesty, you clicked this tab because your are feeling lost and are curious about what coming back to
    Christ looks like. I have good news and better news. While you are looking for Jesus, He is looking for you (good news) also and he has no plans to stop until he finds you because you belong home with him (better news). Your value is immeasurable and you were lost to the world on his watch, while a member of his flock and that's not  ok.</p>
    <p>If you do decide to turn away from
    living a sinful life, and return to life under grace in Christ, It will lead to the most fulfilling life experience
    possible. Jesus said he came to give you life and more abundantly (scrip). Paul reminds you that God have you his
    very best and therefore nothing can separate you from the love of God (Rom 8:38-39). That is the happy ending you
    can absolutely expect. It is literally a promise from God. Now, keep reading and let's help you get there ...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="para2">
      <span class="pix25"><u>REMEDIATION IS NECESSARY</u></span><br><br>
      <p>Ask yourself, what made you choose God in the first place? Who is God in your mind? Who exactly is Jesus in your mind right now?<br>Visit these pages and meditate on their purpose and agree that you belong to the Lord. If you are unsure, follow the steps and become sure.<br>
      <ul><a class="" href="./Pages/salvation.html">Plan of Salvation</a></ul><ul><a class="" href="./Pages/living.html">How to Live a Christian Life</a></ul><ul><a class="" href="Pages/eternallySecure.html">Eternal Security: Am I sure I'm Saved?</a></ul>
  <p>Next, Let's look at where you consider yourself to be. Status and State of Mind.</p>
  <ul class="purple">I am telling you that your status, like all believers, is Righteous because you are saved.<br>Your state is whatever it is and likely not positive since you are on  this page. That's perfectly fine.<br>Be certain that you want better for yourself. God is looking to make a heart connection with you.</ul>
  <p>Finally, Let's agree on a common goal. You be reconciled to the Lord. God wants you Home. You can get back.
    <span class="verse1 purple point"><u>(II Cor 5:18-21)</u></span>
    <ul id="IIcor5">"All this  is from  God,  who reconciled himself to us through Christ and  gave us the ministry  of reconciliation: that God  was  reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though  God were making  his appeal  through us. <b>We implore you on God's behalf: Be reconciled to God.</b> God made him  who  had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might <b>become the righteousness of God."</b></ul>
    <p>The enemy want you  to feel isolated and alone. David describes it this way <span class="verse2 purple point"><u>(Psalms 142)</u></span><ul id="ps142">"... my enemies set traps for me; I
  look for someone to come and help me, but no one gives me a passing thought! No one will help me; no one cares a bit
  what happens to me."</ul>
  <p>Additionally, the apostle Paul wrote in his letter to the people of Colossae something that everyone who feels
    lost, regardless of why or how, needs to remember <span class="verse3 purple point"><u>(Col 1: 13, 21-22)</u></span><ul id="col1">"For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought
    us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Once you were
    alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by
    Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation..."</ul> All of this to say in other words, ACCEPT THE FREE GIFT OF GOD'S GRACE!!!
    </div>
    <div class="para3">
      <span class="pix25"><u>EMOTIONplus</u></span><br><br>
      <p>I sincerely hope you  are beyond excited right now, I know I am. I am celebrating your return to the flock just as Jesus  described in his parable of The Lost Sheep for which  this page is named. I hope  you share your decision with those you  trust so that  they  can support you  moving forward. I  also  want to try  to move beyond the emotion of moments like this as there is work required to maintain  your  walk and keep you from turning away from God's love,protection, and guidance ever again</p>
      <p>Everything we value, everyting we consider important requires time. In order for your spiritual recovery to grow into spiritual maturity you must invest in this  process that will lead to God's purpose for your life. I have a quote on the <ul><a class="" href="Pages/oneliners.html">One Liners for Meditation</a></ul> page which simply states "Never confuse what you are 'going through' with  where you are 'going to'."  and be assured, my friend, that going to God's purpose is worth every sacrifice. I again refer you to begin a daily commitment to the steps outlined in <ul><a class="" href="./Pages/living.html">How to Live a Christian Life</a></ul> and to be very deliberate and intentional with following the steps suggested for living a Christian life. It is literally your life line.</p>

    <!--shares experience with his family and friends. All celebrate. Sheep re-joins flock without judgement or punishment.-->

  <p>The way back home is repentance: Luke 17:3-4<br>The way back is grace: II Cor 12:9-10(maybe?)</p>
  
  <!--<p>Adversity is largely the source of getting lost which begs several questions<br>Why do I have it?(song:"by and-->

  <!--<p>Examples of overcoming Adversity: Jesus, Paul, Job, David, Daniel, Ezekiel</p>-->
  
  <p>Obedience through repentance is the way home. Success Examples: Noah, Lott, Failure Examples: Adam, Eve, Lott's
    wife</p>
  <p>Obedience under the New Covenant is a mindset first which engenders behavior that can be interpreted by: Doing the
    next thing that God is telling you to do and not
    trying to be legalistic with laws and commandments which yes are important but should not be the mindset. Hebrews
    10:1-23 should be the mindset<br>
    <li>Do what
      God says</li>
    <li>Do what God says when God says it</li>
    <li>Do what God says when God says it the way he says to do it</li>
    <li>Do what God says when God says it the way he says to do it for as long as he says to do it</li>
    <p>Repentance is to change your mind from your sinful behavior with full intention to never repeat it habitually
      again and turn
      to God in obedience.</p>
    <p>Finally, understand that the enemy of obedience is Satan who will use the tactics of Distraction, Deceit,
      Discouragement to get you lost again or keep you lost.</p>
    <p>The first act of obedience is to accept the gift(believe Jesus died for your sins and believe Jesus rose from the
      dead never to die again) and become saved.</p>
    <p>Use Prodigal Son and Jonah</p>
    <p>Prodigal Son - Father: God, Son: sinner, Brother: pharisees. Father offered 5 things even before the son could
      repent or request. Son had initial repentance but still rooted in self. Brother had utter contempt for the father
      and brother and likely would kill the father or separte himself under cloud of self-righteousness.<br>** The main
      point of this and the "lost sheep" is to accept the LOVE of the Father and Shephard is true repentance.</p>
    <p>This is a love story between a father and his two sons with a double ending. It is similar to the true account of Jesus on the cross between two theives. Each of these has a tragic and happy ending. The young son is a rebel, a sinner, self-righteous, self-indulgent, selfish and wants to ignore instruction, tradition and standards and go his own way thinking he knows best how to prosper.  His brother is equally a rebel in his own right, working not out of love or loyalty but out of desire to exalt himelf above his father and become leader of his family ______.</p>

    <p>Adversity as a pathway => Unshakeable Faith => Unwearied Patience => Unwaiverieng Courage</p>
    <p>Adversity as a challenge => Bitterness => Loss & Suffering => Depression & Disappointment</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Gal 2:19-21 (Msg Bible) frees you from the mindset of your work and behavior, be it past or present, being a link or connection to a relationship with the Lord. As hard as it is to accept the simplicity of this concept, I need to ask and ask again because God wants you back, God wants you home and he is telling you that Jesus did EVERYTHING required and necessary for you to have Grace and Life more abundantly without judgement.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Paul said in II Tim 3:12 - all who desire Christ will suffer persecution. Jesus said in Matt 5:10,11 - Blessed are those who are persecuted (are you kidding me ... did he  really mean blessed???). Since now you  know to expect persecution it should not lead  you away from your  faith. Rather, meditate on John 15:5 - I am the vine and you are the branch. Abide in me and I in you and you will bear much fruit (paraphrased)</p>
    <p>The things, mindsets, demons, addictions, whatever is holding you back are not fought or won with earthly, worldly weapons. Those things must be brought into the obedience of Christ (II Cor 10:5-6). Then they can be overcome permanently and will no longer have power or a stronghold on you.</p>
    <p>YOUR STORY MUST END WITH YOUR DESIRE TO HONOR AND SERVE GOD. WITHOUT EXCEPTION!!</p>
    <p>YOUR STORY MUST END WITH "THE SMOKE SIGNAL" SYMPOLOGY (chuck swindoll story)</p>
