        <p className="white">You find yourself at this page because something in your 'present day', something in your 'right now' has you discouraged which is one of the three tactics used by the enemy (discourage, distract, deceive). Assuming true, it's not easy to look toward your tomorrow let alone your next hour. But, be encouraged, as I need you to think about THE past with God and then YOUR past with God and look forward to your exciting future with God.</p>
        <p className="white">The word <i
          className="purple">REMEMBER</i> is used 281 times in the bible for a reason and it's because God wants you to never
    forget what he has done for his people throughout and he wants to do the same for you because of his love and <u className="define point vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" title="Grace - 1. God's unmerited favor. 2. Receiving a gift from God that you do not deserve. For Example see Romans 11:5-6.">grace</u></p>
